## Tests
I used Jest NPM package to test the code. There were 4 tests and all tests passed. If you want to run the tests, use the following code:
```bash
npm run test
```

## How to Use
Install the necessary NPM packages to run the program. You will need inquirer and jest. 
```bash
npm install inquirer
npm install jest
```

After you install the NPM packages, open the terminal and run 
```bash
node index.js
```

Input all data for your team. Once you are done, select that you are done. From there, an HTML file will be generated.
